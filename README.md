First of all, if you want to make a portfolio website like this? 

I suggest you visit: https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio

Read the instructions given by CodewithSadee and if you like his work then follow him everywhere ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/codewithsadee
This website is a complete clone of codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio under MIT open source license and I want to thank him for making this available to everyone along with a simple guide.

I also want to thank folks out there who open source their work, we stand on their shoulders that's why our little projects such as this one see the light of day and we don't have to reinvent the wheel every single time.

My website is primarily intended to assist recruiters around the world in contacting me. For others, well.. Thanks!
